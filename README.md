# Data Cleaning in SQL
**Overview**

This project demonstrates practical data cleaning skills using MySQL. The main objective is to transform a raw dataset into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format using SQL queries. To clearly show the impact of the cleaning process, both the original (before) and cleaned (after) datasets are included.

This project is designed to showcase SQL proficiency and data preparation skills relevant to data analyst roles.

# Dataset
- Before Cleaning: Raw dataset containing inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues
- After Cleaning: Cleaned version of the dataset after applying SQL transformations

The datasets are provided to allow direct comparison and transparency of the cleaning process

# Tools
- MySQL
- SQL (DDL & DML statements)

# Steps
The data cleaning process includes:
- Inspecting the raw data structure
- Handling missing or null values
- Removing duplicate records
- Standardizing text formats and values
- Correcting inconsistent or invalid data entries
- Creating a clean final table for analysis or reporting

All transformations are documented and executed using SQL queries.

# Results
Produced a clean, consistent dataset ready for analysis
Improved data quality, readability, and usability

Clearly demonstrated the effect of each cleaning step through before-and-after comparison
